# Drowsiness-Detection-System

## Motivation:
  Car accidents are a big problem in the world and one of the many reason of car accident is driver being in drowsy state.
  According to an article from [sleepfoundation.org](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/drowsy-driving-is-a-factor-in-21-percent-of-fatal-crashes), researchers estimated that around 21% of fatal car crashes involves a person driving in drowsy.

## Intuition
  To prevent such accident, I wanted to build a system that detects driver's face and check if he is in drowsy state or active state. To achieve these functionalities, I used Python and OpenCV for this project.

## Installation:
  * First of all, clone this repository on your pc.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/IRFANSARI/Drowsiness-Detection-System.git
    cd Drowsiness-Detection-System
    ```
    
  * To install all the dependencies which will be required, double click on ```install_dependencies.bat``` file or write this command on cmd and wait for it to finish.
    ```
    start install_dependencies.bat
    ```
    
## Running the program
  * Now all the installation process is done. Just run the python file ```drowsiness_detection_system.py``` by writing the below command on the cmd.
    ```
    python app.py
    ```
